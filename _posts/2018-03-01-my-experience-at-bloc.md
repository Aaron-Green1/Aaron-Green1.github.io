title: My Experience at Bloc
---

[Bloc](http://www.bloc.io) is a coding bootcamp which I chose to go to after much research. Bloc was my choice for a few reasons:

1. They taught the languages I wanted to learn
2. They offered online courses
3. Their price _(let's be real here)_
4. The mentorship program

While I was in college, working towards an unknown goal in computer science, I took a programming course as an elective (C++).  This course restored my childhood hobby of programming.  I quickly decided I wanted to get back into web development and my research showed me just how much the industry had changed since my little HTML/CSS/Flash sites I used to create in middle school with Dreamweaver.

Research revealed that JavaScript had become the king and it had so many libraries and frameworks that I didn't even know where to begin.  That's where sites like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) came in handy.  I did about 70% of the curriculum on FreeCodeCamp, during my down time, and watched countless videos on YouTube creating little one page projects.  _But that wasn't enough_.   It all felt very rudimentary and watered down.

That's where Bloc came in.  

### The Languages I Wanted to Learn

I researched the school curriculum at my college for web design and it, simply put, was farther behind than I was.  I further researched the industry and found that HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS just weren't enough anymore.  At Bloc, they have kept up-to-date with the industry standards and allow their students to choose from an array of languages, based on their personal endeavors.  Personally, I didn't know much about AngularJS, ReactJS, DOM (Document Object Model) Scripting and other such JavaScript frameworks/libraries.  So, when it came to choosing what I wanted to learn, I was well informed and made an educated decision.  

### The Price and Online Curriculum

While Bloc isn't the only code school to offer online courses, it was one of the more flexible ones - offering both full and part time curriculum's.  Most of the online ones were very fast paced and required a ton of work to be done each week - they only offered one _pace_ and it was a full time pace as if you were actually on the schools campus.  Now, while that may work fine for the fresh out of high school future programmer, it's not as forgiving for an adult who has bills and needs to work a full time job to pay such bills!

As for the price, it was actually cheaper than most of the ones I had researched and I was fortunate enough to be offered a $1000 scholarship due to my past experience and the effort I had put into my future before opting to go to a coding school - they felt I was a sure bet!  _And I am!_

### The Mentorship Program

One unique thing I found at Bloc was the mentor program.  For me, being a self starter, learning online came easy.  But there was always something, somewhere that would snag me.  Something that, despite all the internet research and all the threads about the topic on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), I just wouldn't get it.  For me, it was DOM scripting.  Something about the long chains of dot notation that would confuse me beyond all reason.  This is just a minor example, but it blew my mind, when I first started learning the DOM:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
//Use querySelector() to target the element and then add an event listener
document.querySelector(".parent-two.blue").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Grandparent - Capturing!");
}, true);
{% endhighlight %}


However, Bloc setting up a weekly (for part time students) mentor meeting for 30-45 minutes helped me learn from an expert who would be able to set it in laymen terms and helped me overcome my struggle.  Now, I really love DOM scripting (_but JQuery is more fun_).  

On top of the mentor program, Bloc provides round the clock assistance through a series of student only Slack channels.

I have zero regrets with my decision to come to Bloc and I look forward to doing more projects than I have already done and becoming a full stack web developer!
