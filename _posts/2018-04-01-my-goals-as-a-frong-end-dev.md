title: My Goals as a Front End Developer
---

Well, to be honest, I don't believe in "new year, new me", but this year is different.  I'm going to make a plan for the year 2018 and I'm going to share it with you with the reasons why I choose it and chose to do it.

First, a lot has changed since 2017.  I decided to take the first steps to a better future and learn full stack web development.  This is a choice I made based on a lot of factors and I've never regretted the choice.  My first goal is to land my first _junior_ gig and get as much experience in the field as possible.  Hone in and master JavaScript and as many frameworks as I can to be as profitable and needed of an employee as one can be.

Secondly, I wan to _learn_ the industry.  I want to learn the inner workings of client acquisition, client retention, and what the industry does to make the clients (as well as their developers) happy and profitable.  The reason behind this is because one day I may want to start my own business or go free lance.  Even if I don't, knowing those can help me, as a developer, work better with clients to reach the same goal - an amazing product that makes both of us happy and profitable!  

Lastly, since my apprenticeship with Bloc will be ending soon and I'm constantly trying to better myself, I have found a repository that lets me further my self education while not being as strict as an actual educational setting.  This will allow me to work full time and fully focus on all client projects while still furthering my education without the stress of hard deadlines (from school) and grades (though the assignments will be graded).   [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or OSSU is a curriculum created by fellow developers who wanted to pass all the general education parts of a computer science degree and just focus on the computer science parts themselves.  Most of the courses, if not all, are free and self-paced.  They say it can take up to two years to fully complete, if you treat it like a full time college student (I won't be).  It also has the support of a world wide community to help you further in your computer science endeavors.  I feel this would be the best route for me to take, at this point in my life, unless I should decide to get an actual degree.

Here's to 2018 and whatever the future may hold!
