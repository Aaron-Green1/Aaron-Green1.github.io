Texas born, Oklahoma resident. I come from the big city of San Antonio and grew up in the era of the internet.   Wrote my first web site at the age of 13 and must concede, it was absolute <strong>garbage</strong>.   However, it was a great learning experience and it birthed what I, after years of changing majors and <em>finding myself</em>, absolutely love the most and want to do with the rest of my life!  

<h2>The Journey, so far...</h2>

As previously mentioned, I was 13 when my interest for web development first spawned.  It came in the form of a clich√© "fan site."  I was a huge Linkin Park fan and wanted to solidify my fandom by making something that was creative and <em>permanent</em>.  Little did I know, the site wouldn't be permanent and hundreds of thousands of other people, far more advanced than my Adobe Flash, Illustrator and `<MARQUEE>` tags were also doing the same, for profit.

As the web developed, and I grew up, my interests changed.  I went through a few years of college bouncing between three different engineering focuses (electrical, mechanical, and industrial) before realizing it wasn't where my heart was.  I ended up taking a C++ course as an elective and everything just clicked.  It brought me back to my childhood hobby, those countless hours of <a href="http://www.ask.com" target="_blank" alt="ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a> searches - <em>Google hadn't been invented yet</em> - trying to figure out what tag to use for what and how to properly style something in CSS and the infamous `<iframe>` - <em>boy, am I glad we've evolved from that era</em> - and uploading the files through and FTP server with a 56k internet connection!  Those were some fond memories!

All of that has led to here.  My decision to buckle down and learn web development and be a creator, an inventor.  To leave my mark on the world; some how, some way.  The internet is where you create yourself and the opportunties are abundant.  The internet is not going anywhere anytime soon and neither is my love for <strong>#hacktheplanet</strong>!
